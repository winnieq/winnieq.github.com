				<p id="welcome">Welcome! This is my first website, designed and coded by me after teaching myself HTML/CSS for a week. As a side project along with my career, I tend to push myself to learn something, and this is my "final exam".

				</p>
				<h3>It's me.</h3>
				<p id="me">In Chinese, my name means "an imposing girl". I am not (yet), but hoping that I am getting there :) For friends who know me, they said I am indeed really tough. Well, guess I got it from challenges I had taken in the past. My mom did not believe I could do anything, such as graduated from elementary school, or accepted to MIT. Most of the time I prefer to prove people wrong than talking too much... But one thing that is quite common among people who are tough is, <i>They Fail and Stand Up then Move On Right After.</i></p>

				<h3>Ideas</h3>
				<p>Related or not to my career, I have so many ideas and things that I wanted to do. Some are pretty bad-a*s and some, if can be accomplished, can change the world. Here are some of them:</p>
				<ul>
					<li id="idea">Start an organization that sends Fortune 500 CEOs to serve the poorest countries</li>
					<li id="idea">A water device that people can carry around for water purification (this idea is already taken by <a class="normal" href="http://www.vestergaard-frandsen.com/lifestraw">LifeStraw</a>)</li>
					<li id="idea">A fresh food website that provides local fresh produce and delivery for local community (In fact, I have been working on <a href="www.firsthandfood.org">FirstHandFood.org</a> with two of my amazing friends Larissa and Chris)</li> 
					<li id="idea">A food vendor right next to all Boston Green Line T Stop in the morning</li>
					<li id="idea">A video-based classroom that students can ask questions be answered in 10 seconds (Asking questions is very important during learning process in my opinion).</li>
				</ul>
