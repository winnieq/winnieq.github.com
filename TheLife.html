				<p>My life is like a long menu, and everyday is a different dish. They all have a variety of tastes, because of lessons learned, places travelled, people met, events witnessed. But I tend to seperate private life with work; therefore, please do not expect any personal posts here, because they would be on my facebook.</p>  
				<h3>Great Quotes</h3>
				<p>I am not really a book person. But when I enjoy and love doing something, I will try to read everything about it, including books. In middle school, I hand-written a lot of great quotes from articles and books, and put them on a wall of my bedroom. They helped me overcome a lot of hard time (imagine waking up reading walls of colorful papers with inspiring words). Years goes by, I still remember some of them and added some that I want to share with you:</p>
				<ul>
					<li id="quotes">Stay hungry, stay foolish. <i>By Steve Jobs</i></li>
					<li id="quotes">Life cannot be gauranteed.  <i>By Anonomous</i></li>
					<li id="quotes">Pursue something so important that even if you fail, the world is better off with you having tried.  <i>By Tom O'Reilly</i></li>
					<li id="quotes">Failure is the mother of success (Cheesy...but I love it)</li>
					<li id="quotes">故天将降大任于斯人也，必先苦其心志，劳其筋骨，饿其体肤，空乏其身行，行拂乱其所为，所以动心忍性，曾益其所不能。 <i>by《孟子·告子下》</i></li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Things I dislike</h3>
				<p>There are so many things I dislike. People do not respect the environment, being rude for no reason, smoke, etc. I tried to change some of them. For example, protecting the environment was why I decided to be an environmental engineer since freshman year. As time went by, our water is more deteriorating with heavy metals lead, copper, chromium, etc., our air is contaminated with more and more PM2.5, I realized being an environmental engineer is just doing a very tiny part of cleaning up the environment.</p>
				
				<p>I dislike them, and yet cannot change them. But we will change them. We have to.</p>
